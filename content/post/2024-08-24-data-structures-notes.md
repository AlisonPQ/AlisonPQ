Here are some notes about data structures.

### Arrays

| Method | Big O | Observation |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| Lookup | O(1)  |             |
| Push   | O(1)  | can be O(n) |
| Insert | O(n)  |             |
| Delete | O(n)  |             |

#### Static Array

Fixed in size.
```
int[] staticArray = new int[3]; 
```

#### Dinamic Array

Dynamic arrays can change size during runtime

```
List<T> dynamicArray = new List<T>();
```

> Note: While JavaScript arrays are dynamic by nature, you can treat an array as "static" by not modifying its size after initialization. Thereâ€™s no enforcement mechanism for static arrays in JavaScript itself, but the concept is more about intent.
