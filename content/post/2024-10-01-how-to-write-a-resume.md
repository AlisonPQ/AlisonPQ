I have been updating my resume,...let's say I was using brute force, hahaha it's not a good practice because you don't get interviews even to show everything or a little bit you have learned/applied throughout your career.

So I started researching "How to write a good resume", I've read some books, I've also seen tutorials and there are even complete courses on how to impress recruiters and their ATS.

> This post with notes is for my future self because I think I will continue updating my resume, but it is also for anyone who needs it, and since nothing is perfect in this life, if you have any point that you think should be improved in this post, send me a message!

## Six seconds

`Six seconds` is all you get to make a first impression with your resume.

`// Really!?...Yes!`

## Resume Purpose

The purpose is to get you an **INTERVIEW** for a specific role you are going for.

> It is not a Life story, Brag sheet or Get to know you.

So, recruiters are looking for **`Subject matter expert`** or SME.

A recruiter is going to make sure your resume is `ATS friendly`, has a `professional look and feel` and highlights the right `skills and experience` for the role.

> Note: As a tip, they tell you not to use just one resume, instead making tailored resumes for each specific role.

### ATS - Applicant Tracking System

What is? ATS is a tool that helps recruiters and HR stay organized with all resumes they get. When someone applies on the company website the ATS takes that information and puts it into the right categories that helps to recruiters do their job.

The `problem` is when the ATS cannot read certain information because of how it is formatted.

**What DON'T TO DO:** Adding in headshots, different graphics, multiple columns, and fancy fonts.

### Clean Resume Structure

Your resume should be easy to read, so you can follow this structure:

| Section          | Details                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name             | Use biggest font, add your country, phone number, email and LinkedIn link                                                       |
| Summary          | Personal brand as a subject matter expert and share your current or target title, big wins, and metrics.                        |
| Technical Skills | Add your experience level. E.g. `Advanced: Java, Javascript, HTML; Intermediate: C#, PHP, C; Basic: Python.`                 |
| Experience       | **Starr of the resume**, chronological order, most recent on the top, write few lines using `Action verb + Situation + Impact`. |
| Education        | Degrees, languages, certifications                                                                                              |

Experience Example: `Increased web traffic by 110% by establishing...and tracking analytics for over 13 millions visitors per month`

> Action Verbs: Accelerated, Achieve, Automated, Built, Coache, Completed, Coordinated, Delegated, Delivere, Deployed,  Developed, Enhance, Execute, Generated, Gre, Implemented, Increase, Launched, Le, Manage, Negotiated, Reduce, Spearheaded, Surpassed, Transformed.

### Steps to build a beautiful Resume

#### Step 1: Target role

1. Choose target role
2. Save job description

> Do you feel confident in your choice of target role? Whatever your answer are, that is ok, it can feel scary choosing just one role, but remember, this exercise helps you stay focused as you work on that winning resume.

#### Step 2: Job Description (JD)

Dissect it! haha

Look for keywords on JD, there are `hints`.

Break down three elements:

- Title
- Responsabilities
- Requirements

Then, look for five keywords and topics that pop up to us, you can use a **Word Cloud Generator** and eye test, so you can notice technical skill and industry topics.

#### Step 3: Write your best Stories

`Keyword + Experiences`

Connect your skills to the Job, using `keywords` found in the previous step, so answer following questions:

- What project did I use this particular skill?
- What was my specific role in this project?
- What was the impact from this project?

> Try to do the following table on paper.

| Keyword   | Stories                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Keyword 1 | What project? My role? Impact? |
| Keyword 2 | ...                            |
| ...       | ...                            |

> - Friendly reminder: These skills and stories do not have to come from your main experience. these can also be transferrable skills from your side or complementary projects that you did throughout your career.
> - Note: Try to include as much metrics and numbers as possible, when you are describing the impact.

### FAQ

**Q:** How many pages should have a resume? Remember that you just have six second to show your resume.

**A:** One page is ideal if you have less than 10 years of experience, two pages is OK if you have 15 years of experience and maybe three if you have more than 20+.
